  <p>Nepal has ambitious plans in place to turn education around by 2015 and ensure that
    every Nepalese child has an equal chance. The current program begins with 5 years of
    primary school, with pre-primary preparation available only in a few areas. At the end
    of this period, a standard school leaving certificate examination is prescribed.
